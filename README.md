# BlockchainDevelopement



I've created my own blockchain system and wanted to share this code with you all!
If you're looking to develope your own blockchain, this is a great template to start with.

# Let's get started!

A few things to have downloaded are:
- Virtual Studio Code
- Node.js
- Git Bash

# Knowledge Foundations!

I recommend learning a bit about these topics prior to creating your own blockchain. It'll be much easier to adjust this template and create your first genesis block if you have a general idea of these.

- Encryption and Signing
- Hashing Functions
- SHA256
- RSA
- MD5
